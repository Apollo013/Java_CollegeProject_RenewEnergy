####General Overview

This is a web application for a ficticious online-store (RenewEnergy) selling renewable products (wind turbine, solar panels, etc..) and related services.

Along with allowing users to view products and services, there are pdf documents available in relation to each product that can be downloaded, along with guidelines set out by the SEAI on 'The Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP)' and other materials in relation to planning permission, etc ...

There is an administration back-end gui whereby products can be updated, orders placed and user details managed.

Due to the nature of the business, orders are placed by phone, however, orders can be viewed once logged in.

Potential customers can make a query on the 'Contact us' page wherby they will receive a confirmation email upon submitting.
